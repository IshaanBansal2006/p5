## Inspiration
p5 started as a late-night conversation about the gaps we saw in existing solutions. What began as a simple idea evolved into something we genuinely believe can make a difference in how people approach typescript development.

## What It Does
p5 p5. It focuses on providing a streamlined experience that utilizes TypeScript's strengths to deliver results that matter.

## How We Built It
Building p5 was a journey through TypeScript, JavaScript, Smarty, Shell, CSS. Over 0 days of development with 8 commits, we crafted an architecture that balances performance with maintainability. The core is built in TypeScript, using modern best practices.

## Challenges We Ran Into
The biggest challenge was balancing feature completeness with code simplicity. Working with TypeScript, we had to make tough architectural decisions about how to structure the codebase for both current needs and future scalability.

## Accomplishments that We're Proud Of
We're particularly proud of building something that solves a real problem.  The clean integration of TypeScript and JavaScript demonstrates that good architecture doesn't have to be complex.

## What We Learned
This project deepened our understanding of TypeScript beyond just syntaxâ€”we learned about TypeScript best practices. The iterative development process taught us the value of community feedback and the importance of documentation that developers actually want to read.

## What's next for p5
Future development focuses on performance optimization and expanding TypeScript compatibility. We're exploring integration opportunities and considering how p5 can evolve with the changing development landscape.
